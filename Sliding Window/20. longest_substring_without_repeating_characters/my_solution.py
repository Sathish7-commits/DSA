    Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

    A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "zxyzxyz"
    Output: 3

    Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "xxxx"

    Output: 1
